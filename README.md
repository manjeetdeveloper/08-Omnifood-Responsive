# Project Omnifood: A Healthy Food Delivery Company 

This is one of my early projects created alongside with Udemy course:  [Build Responsive Real World Websites with
HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/). Although there are many templates out there we can use for building amazing websites, I have learned so much from building the website from scratch.
